# Rider Tips

## Explorer

- View existing folder as part of solution
  - Great for working on a web app and an api at the same time.
  - Right click on a solution and select Add->Attach Existing Folder
  - The folder will be shown in the Explorer view AND all of the files will be indexed for search etc.
